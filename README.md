Design Pattern for java Developer

This repository contains many example of Design patterns which is very helpful for design an Application eg:<br/>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Factory Method </b>: When a client object does not know which class to instantiate, it can make use of the factory method to create
an instance of an appropriate class from a class hierarchy or a family of related classes. The factory method may be designed as part of the client itself or in a separate class.The class that contains the factory method or any of its subclasses decides on which class to select and how to instantiate it.</li>
<li> <b>Prototype</b>  - Provides a simpler way of creating an object by cloning it from an existing (prototype) object.</li>
<li><b>Singleton</b>  - Provides a controlled object creation mechanism to ensure that only one instance of a given class exists.</li>
<li><b>Abstract Factory Method</b> - Allows the creation of an instance of a class from a suite of related classes without having a client      object to specify the actual concrete class to be instantiated.</li>
<li> <b>Builder </b> -  Allows the creation of a complex object by providing the information on only its type and content, keeping the details of the object creation transparent to the client. This allows the same construction process to produce different representations of the object.</li>
<li><b>Composite </b> -Allows both individual objects and composite objects to be treated uniformly. 
<li><b>Iterator </b> - Allows a client to access the contents of an aggregate object (collection of objects) in some sequential manner, without having any knowledge about the internal representation of its contents.</li>
<li><b>Flyweight</b> - The intrinsic, invariant common information and the variable parts of a class are separated into two classes, leading to savings in terms of the memory usage and the amount of time required for the creation of a large number of its instances.</li>
<li> <b>Visitor</b> - Allows an operation to be defined across a collection of different objects without changing the classes of objects on
which it operates. </li>
